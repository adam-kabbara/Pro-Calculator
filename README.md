# ProCalculator
This calculator application has a basic calculator and multiple unit conversion calculators. It was developed in 2020 and was never updated so there are several bugs. 


## Tools and Languages
This is a calculator application developed in the 
[Dart](https://dart.dev/) programming language using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) ui 
tool kit. 

In order to get all the conversion formulas for the many conversion calculators in this app, I built a small python script (not in this repo) that would web scrape all the different conversion equations automatically and write the Dart code for the conversion functions. I am sure there was a better way of doing this but this is what I came up with at that moment. So, basically what happened was that for a portion of this application's code, I wrote a script that would do the repetitive programming part. I personally find this ironic cause... I build a program to write another program.


## Features
- Basic calculator
- Several unit conversion calculators
- Store all calculations for later revision
- Multiple color themes
- Cross platform (flutter is supposed to be cross platform compatibale but this app has only been tested on android devices)
